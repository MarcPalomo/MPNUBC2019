Hello and thank you for viewing the REPO hosting my Web HW Assignment. In this REPO you'll find the following files:

index.html: This contains the landing page for the project. I used the same text as shown in the HW images to help
with the spacing and sizing of all the components.

Comparisons.html: This is the code for the "Comparisons" Page

data.html: This is the code for the data page. I used the link in the HW instructions in order to create the table
and I used Bootstrap to give it some flair

There are 4 visual pages. When available I used the text from the images in the HW instructions, and when unavailable
I created my own text to fill the space. The analysis came from an old HW assignment; so, I decided to use the exemplar
responses in the instructions if provided in the instructions:

maxTemp.html
Humidity.html
Cloudiness.html
WindSpeed.html

There is also my css file used and referenced in each of the pages listed above: 
styleMP.css 

Lastly, the original data file used and all the pictures inside an Assets folder:

cities.csv
Assets:
fig1 (Latitude vs. Max Temp)
fig2 (Latitude vs. Humidity)
fig3 (Latitude vs. Cloudiness)
fig4 (Latitude vs. WindSpeed)
